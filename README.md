# Welcome to my GitHub Profile

Hej there, my name is Maria. In winter 2022 I mastered an intensive web development coding bootcamp with [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de) acquiring Frontend skills. After my communications design studies I was freelancing for 10 years as a portrait and documentary photographer and trainer, giving lectures and workshops in photography, multimedia storytelling and post production. Besides photography I love beautiful design, simplicity, and I love to learn.
