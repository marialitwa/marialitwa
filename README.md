# Welcome to my GitHub Profile

My name is Maria. Currently I'm learning Web Development at a coding bootcamp with [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de) acquiring Frontend skills. After my communications design studies I've been freelancing for 10 years as a portrait and documentary photographer. Additionally I'm giving lectures and workshops in photography, multimedia storytelling and post production.

Besides photography I love beautiful design, simplicity, and I love to learn.
